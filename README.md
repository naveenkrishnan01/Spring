# Spring Config Example

In this example the code shows how to use Spring config file to load data from external source , in this case property file .The three main componenets are

  - Spring Config file - config.xml
  - Propery file - data which is read into the config
  - Code  - Interface,class that implement interface and Main program


### Process and Output
The program reads the properties file data and display the output. The idea is to show that the code is reusable and the input data in the property file can be changed and the same code can be re-used using the Spring framework

### Additional Comments
Most of the projects are done now using Java annotations with less usage of config file because the maintenance can become cumbersome for large complex projects.
